    Mental health nowadays has become one of the most common worries among young adults and adolescents. Despite how common it is, mental health issues are still stigmatized and warning signs ignored. Mental health issues can impact a person emotionally, socially, and psychologically. For those who suffer from mental illnesses, seeking help is avoided due to its impact they think it may have on their image amongst others. We seek to normalize mental illnesses in order to make many feel more comfortable to recover through getting help from anyone, whether it is a therapist, family members, or friends.

  <p>
    This game portrays a person sufferring from a mental issue and his or her path to recovery.
    <p>The user has a choice between four different issues: </p>
    <p><strong>-major depression</strong></p>
    <p><strong>-loneliness</strong></p>
    <p><strong>-self-image</strong></p>
    <p><strong>-social anxiety</strong></p>
    <p>The game begins with the character in the midst of any of these issues, and recieves help from a therapist, parents, and another frind. It illustrates the inconsistincy of menatal health issues; at one point a person could be enjoying life but the next day that same person is struggling mentally. This is conveyes through the tones of the scenes: as the scene gets more gray, the character's struggles increase and as the image gets warmer, the character is getting closer to recovery. This reflects the lack of predictability when it comes to mental health issues. All scenerios, despite the different choices the user chooses and the diverging paths, lead to recovery.</p>
